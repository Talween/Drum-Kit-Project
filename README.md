# Drum-Kit-Project
I have created a drum kit project that works with key event listeners using javascript, html and css

This project has been designed as part of my Udemy full stack certification, with the help of my learning, I implemented the use of buttons in the .html file and classes. Main functionality of the project has been created with javascript, using click and keypress event listeners. I used switch statements to play different sounds based on the key user presses. 

For button animation effect, I created a class called press in my .css file, which I activated with the help of Timeout function in index.js file.

This gave a real time animation effect, generated with button press. I think overall with the combination of html, css and javascript, it was easy to build this project, while maintaining a nice UI interface and responsiveness.
